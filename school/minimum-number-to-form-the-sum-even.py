Minimum number to form the sum even

Given an array, write a program to add the minimum number(should be
greater than 0) to the array so that the sum of array becomes even

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first and last line of each test case consists of an integer n.
Next line of each test case cinsists of n spaced integers.

Output:
Print the minimum number required to the array so that the sum becomes even .

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=n<=1000
1<=a[i]<=100000

Example:
Input:
2
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
